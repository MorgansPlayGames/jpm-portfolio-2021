          "I played Bloodborne just after beating Dark Souls 3. It is subversive with it's use of Victorian times, mixed with some H.P. Lovecraft madness. This is Dark Souls, but horror. Screaming pierces your ears from all sides, monsters jump out at you from behind, it is constantly dark, with only your torch to see. The first part of the game is a nighmare of difficulty, as it forces you to actually learn mechanics, rather than run through guns blazing. Trying to survive the high tensity atmosphere that this game bleeds, makes it all the better. Patience and careful timing are key to progressing through the game. I am currently trying to beat this one. I am making good progress!",

I played Warcraft II, loved Starcraft, played tons of Warcraft III, and finally, after getting a good enough internet connection, and begging my dad for it, we purchased a subscription to World of Warcraft. I didn't actually get to play much, as I was grounded throughout Classic and most of The Burning Crusade, but I kept up on the lore, discussed it with my friends who actually played, and taught my sister how to play the game so I could watch her. I set up a bot so I could get to level 60, which got my account banned... I just wanted to kill Onyxia!",
