      "Way back in highschool, I was permanantly grounded from videogames. So in retaliation, I took a ton of computer classes, and had World of Warcraft installed on the school's network so everyone could play it.", "I created a private server that allowed my friends to play for free, hosting it on my family's computer, remoting in to start the server up when it shut down and no one was home.", "I also got to play halo by installing it on my iPod and plugging that into any computer. I probably caused a lot of network problems for my school.",

      "School was never my strong suit. I could not focus on or remember to do/turn in homework, I was disorganized, suffering from undiagnosed attention deficit disorder. The only thing my parents could think to do was to take away my videogames until I got my grades up. I unfortunately, even with the motivation of being able to play a game, I could not remember to do homework.",
      "Summers were particulary difficult as I didn't have many close friends or a social life. I did find a loophole though. If I could make my own game, I could play it. It is educating myself and parents agreed that it could be good for me.",
      "I started out reading a visual basic book, and made a two-dimention, top down airplane shooter. I didn't learn much, as I copied directly from the book, and spent a lot of time correcting my mistakes.",
      "The next project I created was a choose your own adventure game in C++ using the console in and console out.",
      "Watching the Lord of the Rings, the Two Towers features, I saw that they were using 3D modeling and simulation to create massive armies for the film. I got the free trial of Maya, and hated it, couldn't figure anything out. Then found Blender3D. I could follow the tutorials and created simple animations and models. I figured out how to render liquid simulations, and created a simple arena push opponent out game. All before highschool",
