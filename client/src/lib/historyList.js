    story:
      "Way back in highschool, I was permanantly grounded from videogames. So in retaliation, I took a ton of computer classes, and had World of Warcraft installed on the school's network so everyone could play it. I created a private server that allowed my friends to play for free, hosting it on my family's computer, remoting in to start the server up when it shut down and no one was home. I also got to play halo by installing it on my iPod and plugging that into any computer. I probably caused a lot of network problems for my school.",
